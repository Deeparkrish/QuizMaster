**Password Generator with starter code**

**Objective**

 An application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria that user has selected.
 This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. 

The following have been incorporated in this project in the Java script function :
  * When the user clicks the button to generate a password-  A prompt appears asking for the password length between 8-128 characters.
  * The user input for the password lengt and type has been validated 
  * The user is prompted for character types to include in the password- He is given an option choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special character.
  * The user input is validated, making sure that at least one character type is selected.
  * Based on the user's choice of character types, the corresponding arrays are merged into a single CharArray.
  * An index value is obtained using Math.random() function on the array.
  * The character at that index is chosen and added to the password string.
  * A final check is done to make sure that all the character types requested by the user occur atleast one in the password string. 
  * The generated password is returned to the main function as per the user requirement.
  * The password is written to the page.
